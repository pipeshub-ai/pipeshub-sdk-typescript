# ConversationStreamRequestProtocol

AG-UI is the only supported wire protocol. When present must be
`"agui"`. Omitting the field is equivalent — the server always
uses the AG-UI vocabulary (`RUN_STARTED`, `TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT`,
etc.). Kept in the schema for backward compatibility with callers
that already send it.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { ConversationStreamRequestProtocol } from "@pipeshub-ai/sdk/models";

let value: ConversationStreamRequestProtocol = "agui";
```

## Values

```typescript
"agui"
```
