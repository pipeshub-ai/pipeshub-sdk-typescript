# RegenerateRequestProtocol

AG-UI is the only supported wire protocol. When present must be
`"agui"`. Omitting the field is equivalent — the server always
uses the AG-UI vocabulary. Kept in the schema for backward
compatibility with callers that already send it.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { RegenerateRequestProtocol } from "@pipeshub-ai/sdk/models";

let value: RegenerateRequestProtocol = "agui";
```

## Values

```typescript
"agui"
```
