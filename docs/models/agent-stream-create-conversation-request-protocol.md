# AgentStreamCreateConversationRequestProtocol

AG-UI is the only supported wire protocol. When present must be
`"agui"`. Omitting the field is equivalent — the server always
uses the AG-UI vocabulary (see `AgentStreamSSEEvent`). Kept in
the schema for backward compatibility with callers that already
send it.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { AgentStreamCreateConversationRequestProtocol } from "@pipeshub-ai/sdk/models";

let value: AgentStreamCreateConversationRequestProtocol = "agui";
```

## Values

```typescript
"agui"
```
