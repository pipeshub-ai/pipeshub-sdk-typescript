# ConversationMessageStreamRequestProtocol

AG-UI is the only supported wire protocol. When present must be
`"agui"`. Omitting the field is equivalent — the server always
uses the AG-UI vocabulary (see `ConversationMessageStreamSSEEvent`).
Kept in the schema for backward compatibility with callers that
already send it.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { ConversationMessageStreamRequestProtocol } from "@pipeshub-ai/sdk/models";

let value: ConversationMessageStreamRequestProtocol = "agui";
```

## Values

```typescript
"agui"
```
