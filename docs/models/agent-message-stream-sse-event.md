# AgentMessageStreamSSEEvent

Server-Sent Event envelope for `POST /agents/{agentKey}/conversations/{conversationId}/messages/stream`.
`data` is a JSON-encoded string whose shape depends on `event`.

Three events have stable API-defined payloads:

- `connected` — `{ "message": "SSE connection established" }`. Fired once
  after the SSE stream opens. No `conversationId` is included because it is already
  present in the request path.
- `complete` — `{ "conversation": AgentConversation, "recordsUsed": number,
  "meta": { "requestId": string, "timestamp": string, "duration": number,
  "recordsUsed": number } }`. Fired once after the upstream AI `complete` payload
  is parsed, citations are saved, and the updated conversation is persisted.
- `error` — `{ "error": string, "details"?: string }`. Fired for runtime failures
  after the stream has already started, including conversation lookup failures,
  upstream AI startup failures, save failures, and stream transport errors.

All other events are forwarded from the upstream agent backend. Common event names:

- `status` — progress update for the current agent phase.
- `answer_chunk` — incremental token batch with running accumulated text.
- `tool_calls` / `tool_call` / `tool_success` / `tool_error` / `tool_result` /
  `tool_execution_complete` — tool lifecycle events emitted by the upstream agent.
- `restreaming` — the upstream agent restarted generation with refreshed context.
- `metadata` — auxiliary metadata or keep-alive payload from the upstream agent.

Important wire behavior:

- The upstream agent's `complete` event is consumed server-side and replaced with the
  API-defined `complete` event above.
- If the upstream `complete` payload cannot be parsed as JSON, the raw upstream
  `complete` frame is forwarded unchanged instead.
- Unknown future event names may appear and should be ignored by clients.


## Example Usage

```typescript
import { AgentMessageStreamSSEEvent } from "@pipeshub-ai/sdk/models";

let value: AgentMessageStreamSSEEvent = {};
